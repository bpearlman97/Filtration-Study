    "In this study, we attempt to primarily understand and, secondarily, model the filtration capabilities of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) for wastewater treatment.  To do this, we have taken into consideration the following parameters:\n",
    "* Pressure Drop\n",
    "* Pore Size\n",
    "* Particle Density\n",
    "* Surface Area for filtration\n",
    "* Feed Stream Velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand MOF application to filtration, it was necessary to first implement filtration of wastewater via common filtration methods, which incorporate dense beds with multiple layers to achieve constricted pore size, high pressure drop, and ultimately purified streams.  From prior studies of filter performance, it has been observed that smaller filter pores often subsequent in increased fouling via pore blocking.  On the other hand, larger pore sizes see similar fouling during cake filtration."
